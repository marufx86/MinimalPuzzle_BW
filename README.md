# Minimal Puzzle B&W

A simple puzzle game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to clear groups of matching symbols on a grid before running out of moves.

## How to Play

1.  Click on any symbol on the grid.
2.  If there are two or more connected matching symbols (horizontally or vertically), they will be cleared from the grid.
3.  Cleared spaces will be filled with new random symbols.
4.  Each move that clears symbols reduces the move count.
5.  The game ends when you run out of moves.
6.  A game over screen will display your final score and provide an option to play again.
